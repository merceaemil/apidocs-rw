## Introduction

The **Rwanda Mineral Data Interoperability Standard** is a comprehensive technical framework designed to enable seamless data exchange and interoperability for mining sector data in Rwanda. This standard is based on the ICGLR Mining Sector Data Sharing Protocol Standards and has been adapted specifically for Rwanda's national requirements. It addresses the critical need for standardized reporting, tracking, and verification of mining operations within Rwanda and for international exchange.

### About Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board (RMB)

The Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board (RMB) is the government agency responsible for regulating and managing the mining, petroleum, and gas sectors in Rwanda. The RMB oversees mining operations, issues licenses, conducts inspections, and ensures compliance with national and international standards for responsible mineral sourcing.

This standard is based on the ICGLR (International Conference on the Great Lakes Region) Mining Sector Data Sharing Protocol Standards, adapted specifically for Rwanda's national context and requirements.

### Key Terms and Acronyms

- **RCM** (Regional Certification Mechanism) / **MRC** (Mécanisme régional de certification): A system designed to combat the trade of conflict minerals in the Great Lakes Region. It ensures that minerals such as tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG) are sourced responsibly and do not contribute to financing armed groups or human rights abuses.

- **RDBMF** (Regional Database of Mineral Flows) / **BDRFM** (Base de données régionale des minerais): A digital platform designed to track and monitor the trade of minerals within the Great Lakes Region. It is a key component of the RCM and supports transparency in the mineral supply chain.

- **NMD** (National Minerals Database) / **BDNM** (Base de données nationale sur les minéraux): The technical data storage facility and application used to manage mining data at country level, implemented by Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board.

- **CoC** (Chain of Custody) / **CdP** (Chaîne de possession): A process that tracks the movement of minerals through their collection, safeguarding, and analysis lifecycle.

- **API** (Application Programming Interface): A connection between computers or computer programs that offers a service to other pieces of software.

### Development History

The Rwanda Mineral Data Interoperability Standard is based on the ICGLR Mining Sector Data Sharing Protocol Standards, which was developed in two phases:

**Phase 1: October 2024 - March 2025**
- Initial development focusing on a subset of data entities: Mine Site, Inspection, License, and Export Certificate
- Presented, discussed, and validated by the ICGLR Technical Working Group in Lusaka, 18-20 March 2025

**Phase 2: October 2025 - December 2025**
- Extended coverage to all data entities referenced in the RCM manual
- Complete Chain of Custody (CoC) implementation

**Rwanda Adaptation: January 2026**
- Adaptation of ICGLR standard for Rwanda-specific requirements
- Integration of Rwanda-specific fields (RDB number, RCA number, business type, etc.)
- Rwanda-specific validation rules and code lists
- Version 2.3.0 - Rwanda Mineral Data Interoperability Standard

The development process included:
- Analysis of existing ICGLR documentation (RCM Manual, Appendices, Data Transfer Procedures)
- Review of Rwanda's national mining regulations and requirements
- Integration of Rwanda-specific data fields and validation rules
- Review of national mining cadasters and data structures

### Purpose of This Standard

The mining sector in the Great Lakes region faces challenges related to:
- **Transparency**: Ensuring accurate reporting of mining activities
- **Traceability**: Tracking minerals from mine to export
- **Compliance**: Meeting international standards for conflict-free minerals
- **Interoperability**: Enabling different countries' systems to communicate

**The Problem**: Currently, there is no standardization in place related to mining data models used at the national level in Rwanda. Manual data input and Excel imports are inefficient and unsustainable. The National Minerals Database cannot effectively collect information due to lack of uniform digitalization and data standardization.

**The Solution**: This standard provides a standardized "language" for mining data in Rwanda, ensuring that information can be understood and processed consistently across all systems. It enables:
- Automated data exchange between national systems and international partners (including ICGLR)
- Interoperability between systems at the national level
- Standardized data storage for consistency, audit, and control
- Compliance with ICGLR RCM requirements while meeting Rwanda-specific needs

### Key Benefits

- **Standardized Data Format**: All countries use the same data structure
- **Automated Validation**: Built-in checks ensure data quality
- **Chain of Custody Tracking**: Complete traceability of minerals
- **API-Based Exchange**: Modern, programmatic data sharing
- **Flexible Implementation**: Countries can adapt existing systems
- **Language-Independent**: Uses integer codes instead of text for status values
- **Semantic Interoperability**: Based on ontological approach, independent of technical implementation

## For Non-Technical Readers

### What Does This Project Do?

Imagine you're trying to send a letter to someone in another country. You need to:
1. Write it in a language they understand
2. Use the correct address format
3. Include all necessary information
4. Follow postal regulations

Similarly, when countries need to share information about mining operations, they need a common format. This project provides that format.

### The Problem It Solves

**Before this standard:**
- Country A tracks mine sites using one format
- Country B uses a completely different format
- When they try to share data, it's like speaking different languages
- Information gets lost or misunderstood
- Manual translation is required, which is slow and error-prone

**With this standard:**
- All countries use the same format
- Data can be automatically shared and understood
- Systems can "talk" to each other directly
- Information is consistent and reliable

### Real-World Example

Let's say Rwanda wants to verify that a shipment of minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is legitimate:

1. **Mine Site Registration**: DRC registers a mine site with a unique ID (like `CD-4.0511+21.7587-00001`)
2. **Production Tracking**: When minerals are extracted, a "lot" is created with all details
3. **Chain of Custody**: As minerals move from mine → trader → processor → exporter, each step is recorded
4. **Export Certificate**: When exported, an ICGLR Regional Certificate is issued by Rwanda
5. **Verification**: Rwanda can query the system to verify the certificate and trace back to the original mine

All of this happens automatically through standardized APIs, ensuring transparency and preventing fraud.

### Key Concepts Explained Simply

#### 1. Mine Site
A physical location where mining occurs. Each site gets a unique ID that includes:
- Country code (e.g., RW for Rwanda)
- GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- A sequential number

Example: `RW-1.9641+30.0619-00001` means:
- Country: Rwanda (RW)
- Location: Latitude 1.9641, Longitude 30.0619
- Site number: 00001

#### 2. Export Certificate
A digital certificate that proves minerals were legally extracted and exported. It includes:
- Who exported it
- Who imported it
- What minerals
- Where they came from
- Verification details

#### 3. Chain of Custody (Lot)
A record that tracks minerals as they move through the supply chain:
- Production at the mine
- Purchase by traders
- Processing
- Transportation
- Export

Each step creates a "lot" record, like a receipt that follows the minerals.

#### 4. Status Codes
Instead of using words (which vary by language), the system uses numbers:
- **Certification Status**: 0=Blue, 1=Green, 2=Yellow, 3=Red
- **Activity Status**: 0=Abandoned, 1=Active, 2=Non-active

This ensures everyone understands the same thing, regardless of language.

### How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Country A** has a mining database system
2. **Country B** has a different mining database system
3. Both systems implement this standard
4. When Country A needs to verify something from Country B:
   - Country A's system sends a request (like asking a question)
   - Country B's system responds with data in the standard format
   - Country A's system automatically understands and processes it

### What This Means for Governments

- **Better Oversight**: Can track minerals across borders
- **Faster Verification**: Automated checks instead of manual review
- **Reduced Fraud**: Standardized tracking makes fraud harder
- **Compliance**: Easier to meet international requirements
- **Transparency**: Citizens can see verified mining data

### What This Means for Mining Companies

- **Simplified Reporting**: One standardized format for all mining data in Rwanda
- **Faster Processing**: Automated systems process data quickly
- **Market Access**: Easier to export to international markets with ICGLR compliance
- **Compliance**: Built-in validation ensures compliance

### What This Means for Citizens

- **Transparency**: Can verify mining operations are legitimate
- **Accountability**: Clear tracking of mineral flows
- **Trust**: Standardized system builds confidence
- **Development**: Better data supports better policies

### Semantic Model

The implementation is based on the Rwanda Mineral Data Interoperability Standard semantic model (Version 2.3, January 2026), which is derived from the ICGLR Data Sharing Protocol Standards semantic model, developed following ISO and CEN (European Committee for Standardization) best practices. The model follows an **ontological approach**, describing entities and their attributes, and the relationships between them.

#### Entity Structure

The model distinguishes between:

**Primary Entities** (not included in other entities):
- **MD.01 Mine Site**: Core mining site information
- **MD.03 Export Certificate**: ICGLR export certificates  
- **MD.12 Lot**: Chain of Custody tracking

**Secondary Entities** (referenced by primary entities):
- **MD.02 License**: Mining licenses
- **MD.04 Business Entity**: Companies and organizations
- **MD.05 Address**: Address with ISO 3166-2 subdivisions
- **MD.06 Geolocalization**: WGS 84 coordinates
- **MD.07 Inspection**: Mine site inspections
- **MD.08 Mine Site Location**: Location details
- **MD.09 Contact Details**: Contact information
- **MD.10 Status History**: Certification status changes
- **MD.11 Tag**: Lot tags
- **MD.13 Tax**: Tax payment information

Secondary entities can be nested. For example:
- Mine Site HAS Mine Site Location
- Mine Site Location HAS Geolocalization AND HAS Address

**Key Principles:**
- Each entity includes attributes and can reference other entities
- Each attribute has a Data Type from ISO 15000-5:2014, Annex B Primitive Types
- Each attribute has Cardinality, Name (Business Term), Description, and Semantic Data Type
- The model is technology-independent and can be represented in JSON, XML, JSON-LD, or SQL

**Rwanda-Specific Extensions:**
The Rwanda Mineral Data Interoperability Standard includes several Rwanda-specific fields that extend the base ICGLR standard. These fields are marked as **Rwanda-specific** throughout this documentation and include:
- **MD.01 Mine Site**: `allowedTags`, `minesLocations`
- **MD.04 Business Entity**: `rdbNumber`, `rcaNumber`, `businessType`, `otherInfo`
- **MD.11 Tag**: `representativeRMB`, `tagType`
- **MD.12 Lot**: `miner`, `price`
- **MD.05 Address**: Rwanda-specific subnational division codes and values
- **MD.07 Inspection**: Rwanda-specific file size limitations (8 MB)

**Naming Convention:**
- **Business Terms**: Human-readable terms that describe concepts (e.g., "ICGLR Identification number")
- **Technical Terms**: Transcriptions of business terms in `camelCase` (e.g., `icglrId`)
- The standard uses `camelCase` as it is the most human-readable and aligns with other standardization initiatives (e.g., https://spdci.org/)

**Cardinality Notation:**
- `1..1` - Required, only once (at least one, at most one)
- `0..1` - Optional, only once (at most one, or none)
- `0..n` - Any number of occurrences, or none
- `1..n` - Any number of occurrences, at least one
- `1..X` - At most X specific number, at least one

**Primitive Data Types:**
- **Date**: Calendar day in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Decimal**: Subset of real numbers represented by decimal numerals
- **String**: Finite sequence of characters
- **Identifier**: Finite sequence of characters adhering to a format rule (subtype of String)

The semantic model defines:

- **MD.03 Export Certificate**: ICGLR export certificates
- **MD.12 Lot**: Chain of Custody tracking

#### Secondary Entities

- **MD.02 License**: Mining licenses
- **MD.04 Business Entity**: Companies and organizations
- **MD.05 Address**: Address with ISO 3166-2 subdivisions

**Important Notes:**
- The "Inspection number" (inspectionId) is not mandated by the RCM manual, but it is highly useful as a single unique identifier, particularly in the context of data storage, reporting and querying. Its addition was recommended by the ICGLR secretariat technical team
- Usage of the File element (inspectionReport) should not be treated lightly because it is one of the most important causes for the growth of storage space on medium and long run, and can also generate risks in the data transfers between countries and ICGLR, as the data batches will grow larger and will be more prone to transaction errors due to the long time of transfer in low bandwidth conditions
- The current practice remains that the reports are scanned and stored as files, which tend to have relatively large sizes. Therefore, one usage rule that we can expect to be imposed by member states is the limiting of the size of the files to be uploaded and exchanged in the system
- **Rwanda-specific**: The file size is limited to 8 MB

- **dateOfChange**: Date of status change (required, Date)
- **newStatus**: The status acquired after the change (required, references MDC.01 Certification Status)

- `FORBIDDEN` (403): Insufficient permissions
- `INTERNAL_ERROR` (500): Internal server error

### Implementation Guide

#### Step 1: Review the Standard

1. Read `README.md` for overview
2. Review `conformance/rules.md` for requirements
3. Examine `schemas/` for data structures
4. Check `api/openapi.yaml` for API specification

#### Step 2: Choose Implementation Approach

**Option A: Direct Implementation**
- Implement OpenAPI spec directly
- Best for new systems
- Full control over implementation

**Option B: Adapter Pattern**
- Build adapter layer over existing system
- Best for legacy systems
- Minimal changes to existing code

**Option C: GraphQL Gateway**
- Use GraphQL to federate multiple sources
- Best for multiple data sources
- Flexible querying

#### Step 3: Data Model Mapping

Map your internal data model to ICGLR schemas:

1. Identify equivalent fields
2. Handle missing fields (make optional or provide defaults)
3. Transform data types if needed
4. Map enumerations

**Example Mapping:**

```javascript
// Your internal model
{
  mineId: "M001",
  mineName: "Kivu Mine",
  country: "RW",
  location: { lat: -1.94, lng: 29.87 },
  status: "Certified"
}

// ICGLR format
{
  icglrId: "RW-1.9400+30.8700-00001",
  addressCountry: "RW",
  nationalId: "M001",
  certificationStatus: 1,  // 1 = Green (Certified)
  activityStatus: 1,        // 1 = Active
  mineSiteLocation: {
    geolocalization: {
      lat: -1.94,
      long: 30.87
    },
    nationalCadasterLocalization: "...",
    localGeographicDesignation: {
      country: "RW",
      subnationalDivisionL1: "RW-02",
      addressLocalityText: "Muhanga"
    }
  },
  mineral: ["IMA1960-001"],
  license: [...],
  owner: {...}
}
```

#### Step 4: Implement Validation

```javascript
const validator = require('./conformance/validators/schema-validator');

function createMineSite(req, res) {
  // Validate against JSON schema
  const result = validator.validate(req.body, 'mine-site');
  
  if (!result.valid) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
      message: 'Request validation failed',
      details: result.errors
    });
  }
  
  // Validate ICGLR ID format
  const icglrIdPattern = /^[A-Z]{2}-[+-]?[0-9]+\.[0-9]{4}[+-][0-9]+\.[0-9]{4}-[0-9]+$/;
  if (!icglrIdPattern.test(req.body.icglrId)) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
      message: 'Invalid ICGLR ID format. Expected: CC-[Lat]-[Long]-NNNNN'
    });
  }
  
  // Process valid data...
}
```

#### Step 5: Implement Endpoints

Follow the OpenAPI specification for:
- Request/response formats
- HTTP status codes
- Error handling
- Pagination
- Filtering

#### Step 6: Error Handling

Implement consistent error handling:

```javascript
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  if (err.name === 'ValidationError') {
    return res.status(400).json({
      code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
      message: err.message,
      details: err.details,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
  
  if (err.name === 'NotFoundError') {
    return res.status(404).json({
      code: 'NOT_FOUND',
      message: err.message,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
  
  res.status(500).json({
    code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR',
    message: 'An internal error occurred',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```

```

#### Deployment

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions.

**Environment Variables:**
```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_PATH=./data/icglr.db
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

### Key Technical Concepts

#### ICGLR ID Format

Mine sites use a standardized ICGLR Mine Site Identification Number format:
```
CC-[Lat]-[Long]-NNNNN
```

**Example:** `RW-1.9641+30.0619-00001`
- `RW`: Country code (Rwanda) - ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
- `1.9641`: Latitude with 4 decimals (WGS 84, no cardinal point)
- `+30.0619`: Longitude with 4 decimals (sign included, no cardinal point)
- `00001`: Sequential number

**Design Rationale:**
- The format is "offline-friendly" - can be generated without requiring technical system processing
- Uses geocoordinates already required by RCM, ensuring automatic generation and uniqueness
- Independent of any attribute changes (certification status, activity status, licenses, owner, inspections)
- Simple, linear, predictive, sequential approach
- Stored identically at country level and ICGLR level for direct identification

**Validation Pattern:**
```regex
^[A-Z]{2}-[+-]?[0-9]+\.[0-9]{4}[+-][0-9]+\.[0-9]{4}-[0-9]+$
```

**Business Term**: ICGLR Identification number  
**Technical Term**: `icglrId`  
**Cardinality**: 1..1 (Required, only once)

#### camelCase Naming

All field names use camelCase:
- ✅ `icglrId`
- ✅ `certificationStatus`
- ✅ `mineSiteLocation`
- ✅ `dateOfIssuance`
- ❌ `icglr_id` (snake_case)
- ❌ `CertificationStatus` (PascalCase)

#### Status Codes

Use integer codes for language independence:

**Certification Status:**
- `0` = Blue
- `1` = Green
- `2` = Yellow
- `3` = Red

**Activity Status:**
- `0` = Abandoned
- `1` = Active
- `2` = Non-active

**CoC Roles:**
- `1` = Miner
- `2` = Trader
- `3` = Shipper
- `4` = Processor
- `5` = Warehouse
- `6` = Importer
- `7` = Exporter
- `8` = Government

**Originating Operations:**
- `1` = Production
- `2` = Purchase
- `3` = Combination
- `4` = Processing
- `5` = Transportation
- `6` = Storage/Warehousing
- `7` = Import
- `8` = Export

#### Mineral Codes

Support for two code systems:

**HS Codes (Harmonized System):**
- Gold: `7108.12.00`
- Cassiterite: `2609.00.00`
- Wolframite: `2611.00.00`
- Coltan: `2615.90.00`

**IMA Codes (International Mineralogical Association):**
- Gold: `IMA1960-A`
- Cassiterite: `IMA1960-001`
- Wolframite: `IMA2000-014`
- Coltan: `IMA1979-A`

#### Chain of Custody

The Lot entity (MD.12) supports complete Chain of Custody tracking:

**Key Features:**
- Recursive `inputLot` references for transformations
- Conditional requirements (e.g., `mineSiteId` and `tag` required for Production)
- Support for all CoC operations
- Tax payment tracking
- Transformation support (1-to-1, 1-to-n, n-to-1, n-to-n)

**Example Flow:**
```
Mine Site → Lot (Production) → Lot (Processing) → Lot (Export) → Export Certificate
```

### Standards Compliance

This implementation follows:

- **ISO 3166-1**: Country codes (alpha-2) - Two-letter country codes
- **ISO 3166-2**: Subnational division codes - Format: `CC-XX` (e.g., `RW-02` for Southern Province, Rwanda)
- **ISO 8601**: Date and time formats - Calendar date complete representation (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **ISO 15000-5:2014, Annex B**: Primitive types - Date, Decimal, String, Identifier
- **WGS 84**: Geographic coordinates - Decimal degrees with 4 decimals, no cardinal points
- **UN/ECE Recommendation N°. 20**: Units of measure - Codes for Units of Measure Used in International Trade
- **UPU S42 / ISO 19160-1**: Locality designation standards
- **ISO 4217**: Currency codes (3-letter codes)
- **JSON Schema Draft 7**: Schema validation
- **OpenAPI 3.0.3**: API specification
- **JSON-LD 1.1**: Linked data

### Adoption and Implementation Considerations

**For ICGLR:**
- Development and formal adoption of the standard
- Establish access policy for the standard and its components
- Support member states in adopting the standard
- Validate correct implementation to ensure interoperability
- Maintain validation artifacts and tools
- Maintain and update the standard with transition terms

**For Member States:**
The standard can be used in three ways:

1. **Technical Mapping**: Map national mining data to the ICGLR data model for interoperability
2. **Extension**: Add new entities and attributes without altering the core model
3. **Derivation**: Add extensions and documented exceptions (may challenge interoperability)
4. **Usage Specification**: Impose additional rules on formatting, size, or values (must not break compatibility)

**National Lifecycle:**
- Adoption as national standard (possibly translated)
- Definition of Standard Usage Specification
- Extension of the standard with national-specific entities/attributes
- Maintenance following regional standard updates

**Important Note**: The semantic model is technology-independent. It can be represented as:
- SQL-based database (for RDBMF)
- JSON or JSON-LD (for APIs)
- XML (for batch transfers)
- Any format that allows semantic validation
