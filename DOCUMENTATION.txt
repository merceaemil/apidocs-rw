Preliminary observations

Rwanda has initiated the process of developing a national technical standard to support the interoperability of all systems at national level that handle minerals related data, in particular in the chain of custody of the conflict minerals but not only. This initiative is championed by the Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board and has advanced through dedicated workshops starting in September 2024.

Concomitantly, the ICGLR has initiated the development of a standard in order to support the sharing of data at regional level, for all the 12 member states, as precondition for the effective reporting of national data into the Regional Minerals Database managed by ICGLR. The standardization initiative at the level of ICGLR, supported financially by Impact Transform, is primarily focused on the mine sites and export certificates, including all the data attributes that are composing these data structures. ICGLR is also proposing an unified representation of mine sites identifiers, to be applied by all ICGLR member states, and also a standardized approach for the descriptors of minerals. 
The ICGLR standard should be adopted and implemented by each member state in order to nsure a direct semantic interoperability between the Regional Minerals Database operated by ICGLR and each National Minerals Database, supporting automated data transfers for the data structures as mandated by the RCM manual.

The initiation of the two initiatives presents a direct opportunity for the harmonization of a national minerals data standard of Rwanda with the future ICGLR standard. Therefore, the work being done on the ICGLR standard should be directly used to support the development of the Rwanda national standard.

Approach for the development of the Rwanda Mineral Data Standard

Following the workshop conducted in September 2024 under the organization of GIZ, with the participation of the Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board and different relevant stakeholders, the agreed approach was that the national standard should include the detailed definition of the data entities that are defined in the ICGLR RCM manual, as these are the main data elements generally used in the collection, storage,  processing and exchange of minerals related data. This is also the approach taken by the ICGLR standard. 

The reporting from Rwanda to the ICGLR Regional Minerals Database will have to follow the ICGLR standard, thus anticipating its format, it is optimally to consider the Rwanda standard as a localized version of the ICGLR data model in order to allow direct semantic and technical compatibility.
Following the general methodology applied by international (eg. ISO) and regional ( eg. European Committee for Standardization CEN) standardization organizations, the adoption of a regional standard at national level involves the establishment of a national usage specification that takes into consideration the regulatory context of the country ( laws, guidelines, procedures) and the instituted practice in collecting and managing the information. 
Such specification, which becomes part of the National Standard, can:
Restrict the standard: add rules and restrictions on the data formats and sizing of data attributes
Extend the standard: add additional data entities or data attributes to entities that already exist in the regional standard
Establish exceptions from the standard: In case the national context requires, some specifications of the regional standard can be overridden. However, this would determine direct compatibility issues and can lead to further interoperability problems. In case such requirements are identified, it would be best to determine the possibilities of extending the standard and establish restriction rules, that would establish precedence of applying the national extensions over the original regional standard.

A standard remains an ever-evolving artifact, that will require a dedicated framework of governance and maintenance. Such role is usually involving, to various degrees, the national standardization organization. The usage specification can be directly governed and maintained by the institution in charge with the domain of the standard.

Conventions, entities, attributes and value sets

Conventions used

The Cardinality takes value from the following discrete variants:
1..1 - required, only once (at least one occurrence, at most one occurrence)
0..1 - optional, only once ( at most one occurrence, or none at all)
0..n - any number of occurrences, or none at all
1..n - any number of occurrences, at least one 
1..X - at most X specific number of occurrences, at least one

For example:
Serial Number on a Certificate is 1..1 - required, only once
Inspection on a Mine Site is 0..n - any number, but can be none 
Designated Minerals on a Mine Site is 1..4 - at least one, at most 4

The number of the Primitive Data Types to be used should be kept to a minimum.
The Primitive types are defined and should be identified, as much as possible, from ISO 15000-5:2014, Annex B


The following will be used:
Primitive type
Definition
Representation rule
Example
Date
Time point representing a calendar day on a time scale consisting of an origin and a succession of calendar [ISO 8601:2004]. Should use the “Calendar date complete representation”, without time of the day. Should be represented as YYYY-MM-DD
YYYY-MM-DD 
2024-12-22
Time
Time point representing a time of day on a 24-hour clock following[ISO 8601]
Use ISO 8601 extended time hh:mm[:ss] with an optional zone designator Z or ±hh:mm.
See additional note below for the use of timezone.
08:32:00
Decimal
A subset of the real numbers, which can be represented by decimal numerals.
The decimal indicator as a period. No indicator should be used for thousands or 1000x multipliers. Visual display in user interfaces can format the numbers as expected by users
12423.33
String
A finite sequence of characters.


abcde!23
Identifier
A finite sequence of characters that adhere to a format rule, subtype of String


AB123
File
Describes a file that can or needs to be attached
Mime type and size of file should be indicated specifically and should be validated at submit 


Geocoordinate
A geographic coordinate 
Using the WGS 84 format with 4 decimals, not using cardinal points ( N/S/W/E) but - and + signs
-1.9641,+30.0619



It should be noted that the specified format is directly transcribable in the technical representation, and can be formatted for visualisation in ways most appropriate for the consumption of the final user.

Thus, the format for date is YYYY-MM-DD. This might not be the familiar representation for all final users, thus a software application that might implement the standard might transform, for visualisation purposes, the format into another date representation.
When a type does not contain inherent restrictions related to its size, such as for example String being “A finite sequence of characters”, the technical implementation will require that a restriction is imposed by a rule. Such restriction can either be set in the semantic standard if it is truly justified, or in implementation instructions. The semantic standard should not be restricted by the potential technical means of implementation because it does not restrict such means.Therefore, at the level of the standard we could impose content or format rules, but we should not impose sizes. In technical implementation instructions, it would be advisable to impose sizes, such as “String should have a maximum length of 300 characters”, as this will transpose to the definition of a field of a database, that needs to be specifically restricted due to the needs of storage and technical processing.

The time representation is contextually used in the case of data records, much rarely than the date type, but always together with the date. Thus, keeping the Date and Time as separated types, instead of datetime, is preferable.

The semantic representation of the Core Model is not dependent on the technology of implementation.
The applications that implement the standard might choose an SQL-based data representation, which is perfectly suitable for the Core Model.
The APIs might use a JSON representation or a JSON-LD that carries information on the context and relations between entities. 
In case of lack of direct technical real time connection between the systems that exchange data, the technical format of choice could be XML, based on a custom defined schema.
Any format that will be used should also allow the semantic validation through a Validator component that checks the compatibility of the exchanged data set with the semantic model at the level of its application.

In the scope of the assignment, we will use the notion of Entities, Attributes and Value sets to describe the semantic model of the components of interest.
Three primary Entities are identified, “primary” designating that are not included in other entities.

These primary entities are Mine Site, Export Certificate, Lot.
The primary entities reference secondary entities. We name secondary entities those data structures that have attributes of their own, that can be referenced by different entities and/or  that can be repeatedly referenced by another entity.

Following the RCM manual, we have identified the following secondary entities:
License
Business Entity
Address
Geolocalization 
Inspection
Mine Site Location
Contact Details
Status History
Tag
Tax

The “Mine Site” is the notion used by the ICGLR RCM Manual, which by general definition reflects a location at which a facility for extracting a mineral by underground, strip, open pit or quarry operations exists or is to be developed. The ICGLR RCM Manual does not differentiate between a “Mine Site” and a “Mine”.
In glossaries related to mining, we could not find the definition of both notions in separate form in the same context, however the difference can be extrapolated, such as while a “Mine Site” includes all the facilities operated unitary on a broader surface, the “Mine” refers to a specific excavation ( eg according to the Glossary of Mining Terminology of the Government of Canada, a mine is an “excavation in the earth from which ores and minerals are extracted”)
Other consulted glossaries include the Glossary of Mining Terms of the US Security and Exchange Commission or the of the Government of South Africa.


The Secondary entities could be nested. Thus for example:
Mine Site HAS Mine Site Location, while Mine Site Location HAS Geolocalization AND HAS Address.

Some attributes might not simply take any value allowed by a primitive type, but need to take a discrete value from a specific list, based on specific rules.
These lists of potential values are specifically defined in the data model as Code Lists, and form together a Code Directory.
These Code Lists are:
Certification Status
Mining Activity Status
Mineral
License type
CoC roles
Originating operations
Units of Measurement

The modeling of data specific to the Chain of Custody is centered on the “Lot” entity, which includes all the possible data attributes occurring during all phases in the CoC (explicited in the list of “Originating operations”) and can be recorded by all CoC actors (explicited in the list of “CoC Roles”). The “Lot” provides a compact, normalized data model, that can be used in technical implementation to reconstitute the lifecycle of a lot in the CoC by backtracking based on the originating operation and the input lot(s). The compact model supports any type of lot-to-lot transformation in the CoC, be it 1-to-1, 1-to-n, n-to-1 or n-to-n. 
The technical transposition of the semantic model of the Lot entity is intended to be primarily used for data capturing, data reporting and transmitting, through API, for example as JSON or XML. It is not intended to illustrate directly a structure of a relational database table(s), although the model of one can be derived from it.

Data entities and their attributes
In the following, the proposed semantic model is presented. For each attribute and entity, additional information will be provided in support of the justification of the choices being made:

All Entities, primary and secondary, are numbered, from MD.01 to MD.13 ( MD = Mining Data, a convention internal to this document, that can be replaced in the future)
All Code Lists are numbered, from MDC.01 to MDC.07 ( MDC = Mining Data Codes, a convention internal to this document)

Note 1: “Allowed Tags” is specific to Rwanda, which allocates a list of tag numbers to each mine site. This information is obtained from the functional specification of the DMTS system.

Discussion point 1:
The National Identification Number should follow a clearly-established and easy to validate format that ensures the uniqueness of the ID.
A combination of letters, digits and symbols can be used. If symbols are used, they need to be chosen so that they are not creating incompatibility with future technical formats of representation, such as JSON or XML. Thus, characters in the following group should be strictly avoided <,>,’,”,&,/,\.
The uniqueness of the id should be given by the specific characteristics of the data entity and should not be simply auto-increment, since such IDs could be generated by different systems or even might require that they could be established manually when lacking access to a centralized digital system (for example, in the field). However, it might be feasible to impose strict rules that establish a direct dependency from a centralized data registry, in which case an auto-increment approach could be feasible.

Discussion point 2:
Following the analysis comprised in the Conventions chapter, it can be noted that a Mine Site can include multiple Mines, that each Mine in a Mine Site can have its very specific Mine Location, while the Mine Site Location is in general a broader area whose location is best designated by a polygon. 
In Rwanda, there is specific evidence kept at the level of the Mine. Still, the GIMCS Online Portal illustrates Mine Sites, thus the approach proposed by ICGLR RCM is maintained in the current standard, with the extension specific to Rwanda noting the location of mines, optionally, within a mine site. The specific data related to a certain mine can be extended further with other attributes.

The character zero ( 0 ) in case of unknown origin. Zero can be combined in an array ( eg. BI;TZ;0 ) showing that the mineral comes from at least 3 sources, from which 2 are known.
Date of expiration should not exceed the date of issuance plus 90 days
Certification File MIME type should be included in the subset application/pdf, image/png, image/jpeg

In practical technical implementation, the size of the uploaded files should be limited in order to avoid overloading the storage and processing systems. 
The limitation should be set at least for the Regional Minerals Database ( recommended max size 10 MB), which can be made more strict ( eg. 5 MB, 8 MB) by member states.

MD.12 Lot
The holder of a quantity of minerals that are mined. The Lot is initially constituted at the Mine Site. In local/national practice, the “Lot” can be named in different ways, as Bag, as Package, etc. However, the packaging format is not relevant to the data model used for tracing. 
The same format of the definition of a Lot is intended for transport, processing, or sale.
In the CoC, the “lot” is redefined whenever there is a transformation involving aggregation or disaggregation. 
During all operations through the CoC, each Lot is “bagged, tagged, and sealed”. 
When a Lot is transformed, a new Lot emerges with its own Tag and has reference to the original Lots that were the input for the forming of the lot.

For some fields that are in general optional (0..1, 0..n), their presence might be required in certain circumstances, depending on the stage in the CoC. The validation of their presence is to be established by additional Rules.

Notes on fields that are required or optional:

“Time of registration” - is an attribute proposed in the current standard, not present in the RCM Manual. The Time of registration designates the moment when the respective Lot data record is registered by a software system, given by the software system automatically. This attribute should be protected from altering, however that is a technical function of the recording system. Based on the Time of registration, the recording system or auditing system can verify the order of registrations and can rebuild the time path of the lots through the CoC. The standard does not impose specific validation rules for this field.

The RCM Manual requires that at the recording of the Lot at production site, specific attributes should be recorded ( RCM Manual Appendix B section 1. Standard Information Requirements for Mine Site Operators for each Lot)
It should be noted that in fact the fields 1.3 Customer or Recipient, and 1.7 The date when the lot is shipped, are actually NOT mandatory at the time of registration at production site, since they might not be yet determined, hence they are to be considered optional.

The model proposes a normalisation of the definition of the Lot in the entire CoC. To verify that the model is complete, we present below the correspondences with the RCM Apendix B specification

1. Standard Information Requirements for Mine Site Operators for each Lot
1.1. A unique mine operator lot number for the lot. - lotNumber
1.2. The identification of the mine owner and operator (if different), including name, address and mine site location/permit/concession given with reference to the Mine Site Identification in the ICGLR Regional Mineral Database (RMD), government identification number. - through mineSiteId
1.3. The identification of the customer or recipient, including name, address and site location and government identification number. - recipient ( BusinessEntity)
1.4. A description of the material, including the ore type (i.e. cassiterite), its weight (i.e. 1000kg), and grade (i.e. 45%). - 3 data attributes: mineral, concentration, mass
1.5. Values and details of all taxes, fees or royalties paid to government for the purpose of extraction, trade, transport or processing of the lot, along with any other payments made to government for the purpose of extraction, trade, transport or processing of the lot - taxPaid (entity, 0..n)
1.6. The date when the lot is sealed - dateSealer
1.7. The date when the lot is shipped - dateShipped
1.8. Name of the responsible staff person(s) who verified the documentation associated with the Lot - responsibleStaff

2. Additional Information Requirements for Mine Site Operators for each Lot of Designated Minerals Sourced from other Industrial Mines
2.1. All of the information requirements in 1.1-1.8 above plus:
2.2. A unique purchase order number for the external purchase - purchaseNumber
2.3. The identification of the mine site and mine operator from which the external purchase was sourced, including name, address and mine site location given with reference to the Mine Site Identification in the RMD, government identification number. - through mineSiteId [ a Lot can only have ONE mineSiteID, this is identical to 1.2 and should not be repeated]
2.4. A description of the material, including the ore type (i.e.cassiterite), its weight (i.e. 1000kg), and grade (i.e. 45%) - - 3 data attributes: mineral, concentration, mass [ this is identical with 1.4, should not pe repeated]
2.5. Values and details of all taxes, fees or royalties paid to government for the purpose of extraction, trade, transport or processing of the external purchase, along with any other payments made to government for the purpose of extraction, trade, transport or processing of the external purchase - taxPaid (entity, 0..n) - identical with 1.5
2.6. The date of the purchase - purchaseDate
2.7. Name of the responsible staff person(s) who accepted the Designated Mineral Lot and verified the origin - responsibleStaff [ although expressed differently, this should be identical to 1.8, should not be repeated]


3. Additional Information Requirements for Mine Site Operators for each Mixed Lot of Designated Minerals Sourced from other Industrial Mines
3.1. All of the information Requirements in 2.1-2.7 above plus
3.2. A new unique mixed Lot number - lotNumber
3.3. The weight/mass, ore type, and grade of the mixed Lot - 3 data attributes: mineral, concentration, mass
3.4. The purchase order numbers of each externally purchased Lot included in the mixed lot, along with the weight and grade of ore that each externally purchased Lot contributed to the mixed Lot. - included by reference - 
3.5. Name of the responsible staff person(s) who accepted the Designate Mineral Lot(s) and verified the origin -  responsibleStaff [ although expressed differently, this should be identical to 1.8, should not be repeated]

The formulation of the RCM Manual “All of the information Requirements in 2.1-2.7 above plus” should be interpreted as “All of the information requirements in 2.1-2.7, plus the following, without repeating identical information”, since a mixed lot only has one number (3.2), not two numbers (3.2 AND 1.1). However, the original Lot(s) can be identified by recursive reference.

4. Information Requirements for Mineral Processor, Centre de Traitements, Comptoirs, or Smelters Lot of Designated Minerals Sourced from Industrial Mines
4.1. Information Requirements: Purchases

Rules:

“Time of registration” should be automatically generated by the software system that assists the registration of the Lot data record 
Information specific to a previous stage in the CoC (eg. Production) should be retained in the Lot record in accordance to the requirements of the RCM Manual, thus allowing the Lot record to be fully defined without having the need to backtrack through specifical technical queries in a software system
A Lot that is registered at Production mine site might not have yet the attributes “recipient” and “date shipped”. However, when the registration of a Lot at Production is referred by another Lot record that originates from an operation that indicates a change of custodian, the original Lot record must include the “date shipped” and “recipient” values
If MDC.06 Originating operations is 1 (Production), then fields mineSiteId (“Mine site”), miner (“Miner’s name”) and tag (“associated tag”) are required
